# Traditional vs ML
## Traditional:
rules + data -> traditional programming -> answers
## ML
answers + data -> ML -> rules

# Examples
[[Explanation of helloworld.py]]
[[Eplanation of fashion.py]]
[[N(not n)umbers.py]]

# Limitation
Up until now only 1 item per image and in certain direction (e.g shoe must face left)
solution: [[convolutional neural network]] in combination with [[pooling]]

# Theory
[[Image augmentation]]
[[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]]
